    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    Saving data to an MXA formatted file can be straight forward or involve creating new C++ classes and a recompile
    of the project. Basically there are 2 ways to import data into an HDF5 based MXA data file.
   <br>
    <h5>First Way - Utilize Existing Import Functionality</h5>
    3 Items are needed in order to take advantage of the include functionality.
    <ol>
        <li>A Data Model (preferably in an XML file, but another HDF5 file will work also).</li>
        <li>A Data Import XML file listing the data model file, the output file, 
        corrections to the Data Model and Data Sources.</li>
        <li>Some Sources of Data. Either Tiff/BMP images or other sources that you have 
        custom code to parse.</li>
    </ol>
<br/>
    <h5>Data Import XML File</h5>
    This is a xml file that contains a subset of the Data Model XML, the Output file to write the data 
    into, Data Sources (either Implicit or Explicit) and Support Files.
   <br>
  <table>
  <tr class="row">
      <td>Data Model</td><td>The data model can come from another xml file or another MXA Data File. No matter which 
  file the model comes from, the model only serves as a "template" model. The details of data dimensions can
  be over ridden by the import xml although the Data Records can not. So for example in your "template" model files you 
  may have a Data Dimension with a starting value of 10 and an ending value of 20. If your new data does not quite 
  match up with that then you will have a chance to over ride those values in the Data Import XML file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row"><td>Output File</td>
      <td>XML Tag is &lt;Output_File&gt; This tells the importer where
  to save the MXA datafile.</td></tr>
  <tr class="row"><td>Data Sources</td><td>There are 2 types of Data Sources: Implicit and Explicit. Implicit Data Sources
  are used when the file heirarchy on your local filesystem mimics the data exactly. To use an Implicit Data Source
  you would need to be able to break down the path to the data files in a generic manner and then encode those
  paths into the xml file. Explicit data sources describe <b>exactly</b> where the data file is on your local
  filesystem. If the file is not found then a possible error will be generated (depending on the importer used).</td></tr>
  <tr class="row"><td>Support Files</td><td>These are files that are not directly a source of data but you would like to include
  into the data file. These files can be anything from a simple text file to a binary image file.</td></tr>
  </table>
   <br>
 <h5>Second Way - Create C++ code and Compile a new program</h5>
    Write custom c++ code to complete any or all of the above tasks. This is the 
    course of action to take if your data is in custom data files or 
    in files that the current set of importers do understand. Each of the above tasks 
    can be programatically completed if needed. Quicker solutions
    can be obtained if the model is stored in an XML file. This will cut down on 
    the programatic creation of the data model. If your data happens to be images
     in the form of TIFF or to a lesser extent BMP, then you can use the existing 
     Data Import functionality. <br>
     If your data is in custom files then you will need to write a parser for that 
     data. See the page on creating an ImportDelegate for more information. <br>
     If your data is laid out on your hard drive in such a way that the Import XML 
     can be used this will help reduce the amount of code that needs
     to be written to find the data sources on your hard drive. Instead the locations 
     are describe with some MXA xml tags.
     <p></p>
 <h5>Code Maintainer Notes</h5>
      If you add more xml tags to the list there are a few code places that will need
      to be updated. <i>src/XML/DataImportXMLParser.cpp</i> will need to be updated. Specifically
      you will need to update the following method:
      <code>void DataImportXmlParser::OnStartElement(const XML_Char* name, const XML_Char** attrs)
            void DataImportXmlParser::OnEndElement(const XML_Char* name, const XML_Char** attrs)
      </code>
      In those methods you will need to add additional conditional statements to check for
      the specific tag you are adding.
      <br> You will then need to add the appropriate 
      <code>
          onXXXXStartTag(...) and onXXXXEndTag(...) 
      </code>
      methods to actually process the tags. Look at the rest of the code for examples on how to do that.

    
    
  <h5>XML Import Example</h5>Say you have a bunch of images taken from an experiment
    that has 2 independent variables called "time" and "volume fraction" with units of seconds (for time) and 
    percentage (for Volume fraction). Say you run the experiment for 60 seconds and vary the volume fraction
    from 20% to 60% in 5% increments. Translating this to the MXA Data Model you would end up with 
    2 Data Dimensions (Volume Fraction and Time) and 1 Data Record (Image).<br>
        The Vol. Frac. data dimesion would start at 20, end at 60, have a cout of 9 and an increment of 1.
        The Time data dimension would start at 0, end at 60 have a count of 61 and an increment of 1.
        The Data Record would have a name of "Image".
        <br>
        Now say all this data has been collected and orgnanized into directories with the following format:<br>
        Data/020/000/image.tiff, where the '020' denotes the volume fraction and the 000 denotes the 
        time in seconds. There is a set of directories for every combination of volume fraction and time.
        <br>
        With this setup one can setup an Implicit Data Source in the Import XML file.
         <h5>Example XML Code</h5>
        <code>
&lt;Implicit_Data_Source Data_Record="Record 0" Source_Type="h5TiffImport"&gt; 
  &nbsp;&lt;Import_Property Key="FileNotFoundIsError" Value="1" /&gt; 
  &nbsp;&lt;Import_Property Key="ImportAsGrayScale" Value="1" /&gt; 
  &nbsp;&lt;File_Path&gt; 
    &nbsp;&lt;Text_Part Text="Data/" /&gt;
    &nbsp;&lt;Index_Part 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Padding_Char="0"  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max_Char_Length="3 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numeric_Type="Integer"  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data_Dimension="Volume Fraction" /&gt; 
    &nbsp;&lt;Text_Part Text="/" /&gt; 
    &nbsp;&lt;Index_Part 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Padding_Char="0"  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max_Char_Length="3" 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numeric_Type="Integer" 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data_Dimension="Time" /&gt; 
    &nbsp;&lt;Text_Part Text="/image.tif" /&gt; 
  &nbsp;&lt;/File_Path&gt; 
&lt;/Implicit_Data_Source&gt;
 </code>
 
 <h5>Line By Line Explanation of the Example XML Code</h5>
        <table>
        <tr class="row"><td>
        &lt;Implicit_Data_Source 
            Data_Record="Image" 
            Source_Type="h5TiffImport"&gt;</td>
        <td>Tells the model to associate the data with the "Image" Data Record and use the
        Tiff image importer to import the data.</td>

        <td>Each Data Source can have any number of "Import_Properties". This tells the importer to 
        stop the import process if a file can not be found. This can be good for debugging your
        import xml or if there truly are missing images from your experiment.</td>
