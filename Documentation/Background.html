  <h4>Section 1: Too Many Files</h4>
 While doing research many data files are usuall created. Typically these files are 
  stored in a mish-mash of folders scattered about a users computer system. Important 
  information about the experiment may or may not follow the data. Losing this meta data
  may render the actual data useless to the researcher. Each of these files could be 
  stored in different formats which can be either proprietary or opensource
  
  <h4>Section 2: Data Organization</h4>
 The goal of the MXA project is to allow the researcher to gather all the information and
  data that pertains to a particular experiment and store that information in a single
  location in an open format. Thus allowing the researcher to easily share data with thier
  peers for further analysis.
  
  <h4>Section 3: Data Storage & HDF5</h4>
  HDF5 is a scientific file format under ongoing development at UIUC. The HDF format
  was originally designed to store data being produced on High Performance Computing (HPC)
  systems. After a number of revisions to the HDF specification a complete rewrite was under taken
   to solve some of the limiting issues that had arisen during production use. The latest
   revisiion is version 5, or HDF5. This file format organizes data in a "Directed Graph" which in
   its simplest form can be used in a heirarchical fashion. Any type of data can be stored
   into the file in any organization that the researcher desires. In this way the HDF5
   format is a highly flexible storage format in which to store vast amounts of data.
  
  <h4>Section 4: Data Model</h4>
  The concept of a "Data Model" is introduced in order to bring some consistancy to
  the layout of the data within an HDF5 file. The data model consists of 3 main parts and tries to
  follow generally accepted experimental methods.
  <ol>
  <li>Data Dimensions are the independent variables of a particular data set or experiment</li>
  <li>Data Records are the the dependent variables of the experiment</li>
  <li>Data Root is used to describe the location within the HDF5 file where the actual data
  resides</li>
  </ol>
  The data model is stored in the HDF5 file in a strict location and follows a specification
  that states how the information is stored. By using this type of system, exchange of MXA files
  between algorithms becomes easier and more straight forward. Note that the values that are
  written to the "Data Model" part of the HDF5 file only describe the experiment and the
  layout of the data within the HDF5 file. The actual data is stored in another location
  inside the HDF5 data file.
  <p>The "Data Root" is a value that holds the 'path' to the actual experimental data as it is stored
within the HDF5 data file. The data is stored according to the heirarchy that is laid out in the Data
Model. Using this approach, any piece of data can be quickly found either by a human being or by 
automated processes.</p>
