    <h3>Section 1: Too Many Files</h3>
    While doing research many data files are usually created. Typically these
    files are stored in a mish-mash of folders scattered about a users computer
    system. Important information about the experiment may or may not follow the
    data. Losing this meta data may render the actual data useless to the
    researcher. Each of these files could be stored in different formats which
    can be either proprietary or opensource

    <h3>Section 2: Data Organization</h3>
    The goal of the MXA project is to allow the researcher to gather all the
    information and data that pertains to a particular experiment and store that
    information in a single location in an open format. Thus allowing the
    researcher to easily share data with thier peers for further analysis.

    <h3>Section 3: Data Storage and HDF5</h3>
    HDF5 is a scientific file format under ongoing development at UIUC. The HDF
    format was originally designed to store data being produced on High
    Performance Computing (HPC) systems. After a number of revisions to the HDF
    specification a complete rewrite was under taken to solve some of the
    limiting issues that had arisen during production use. The latest revisiion
    is version 5, or HDF5. This file format organizes data in a "Directed Graph"
    which in its simplest form can be used in a heirarchical fashion. Any type
    of data can be stored into the file in any organization that the researcher
    desires. In this way the HDF5 format is a highly flexible storage format in
    which to store vast amounts of data.

    <h3>Section 4: Data Model</h3>
    The concept of a "Data Model" is introduced in order to bring some
    consistancy to the layout of the data within an HDF5 file. The data model
    consists of 3 main parts and tries to follow generally accepted experimental
    methods.
    <ol>
      <li>Data Dimensions are the independent variables of a particular
      data set or experiment</li>
      <li>Data Records are the the dependent variables of the experiment</li>
      <li>Data Root is used to describe the location within the HDF5 file
      where the actual data resides</li>
    </ol>
    The data model is stored in the HDF5 file in a strict location and follows a
    specification that states how the information is stored. By using this type
    of system, exchange of MXA files between algorithms becomes easier and more
    straight forward. Note that the values that are written to the "Data Model"
    part of the HDF5 file only describe the experiment and the layout of the
    data within the HDF5 file. The actual data is stored in another location
    inside the HDF5 data file.
    <p>The "Data Root" is a value that holds the 'path' to the actual
    experimental data as it is stored within the HDF5 data file. The data is
    stored according to the heirarchy that is laid out in the Data Model. Using
    this approach, any piece of data can be quickly found either by a human
    being or by automated processes.</p>
