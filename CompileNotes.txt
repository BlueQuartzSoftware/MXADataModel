Requirements: 
   HDF5 version 1.6.5 from the HDF5 group
   Tiff Library (optional, but pretty useful)
   Boost (Unit Test and File System) 
   
Windows XP:
    Download boost 1.34.1 from www.boost.org. You will also need bjam.exe from boost.org.
    use the following to configure/build/install Boost
    bjam.exe --toolset=msvc --with-test --with-filesystem install
    Let this go for a looong time after which Boost will be installed into C:\Boost. If
    would like Boost installed somewhere else then add --prefix=C:\Path\To\Install to the above
    configuration line.
    It is helpful to set the "Boost_ROOT" environment variable. This will let cmake find 
    boost easier. It should be set to the same path as the "intall" path from above.
    
    Obtain and Compile HDF5 1.6.5 from the HDF5 Group. This involves some contortions to get
    the Visual Studio projects that are provided to work correctly. Follow their instructions. 
    Install the HDF5 Includes/Libraries somewhere then set the environment variable "HDF_INSTALL" 
    to the installation path. Example, if you installed into C:\Library then set HDF_INSTALL to
    C:\Library
    
    Tiff: Instructions to follow... 
    
Compiling MXADataModel and Unit Tests:
 	Use CmakeSetup to generate the Visual studio solution files. Note when selecting libraries
 	to use the "hdf5dll.lib (windows xp) as the HDF5 library. Cmake may not find this correctly. 
 	Since Visual Studio uses Automatic Linking and Boost uses this to its advantage the only necessary
 	step for Boost libraries is for the cmake file to include the directory where the boost
 	libraries are located into its link libraries list. This is done for you. The Visual Studio
 	linker will look in that location for the needed libraries.
 	
 	Set cmake to build SHARED LIBRARIES for MXADataModel. If you do NOT have libTIFF compiled/installed
 	on your system then turn OFF TIFF support.
